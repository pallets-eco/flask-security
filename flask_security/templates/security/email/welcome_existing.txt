{# This template receives the following context:

  user - the entire user model object
  security - the Flask-Security configuration
  recovery_link - if enabled.
  reset_link - reset link if enabled
  reset_token - this token is part of reset link - but can be used to
    construct arbitrary URLs for redirecting.
  confirmation_link - confirmation link is user not yet confirmed (and enabled)
  confirmation_token

  This template is used when returning generic responses and don't/can't
  provide detailed errors as part of form validation to avoid email/username
  enumeration.
