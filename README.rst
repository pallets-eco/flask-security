Goals
+++++

* Use `OWASP <https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS>`_ to guide best practice and default configurations.
* Be more opinionated and 'batteries' included by reducing reliance on abandoned projects and
  bundling in support for common use cases.
* Follow the `Pallets <https://github.com/pallets>`_ lead on supported versions, documentation
  standards and any other guidelines for extensions that they come up with.
* Continue to add newer authentication/authorization standards:
    * 'Social Auth' integrated (using authlib) (5.1)
    * WebAuthn support (5.0)
    * Two-Factor recovery codes (5.0)
    * First-class support for username as identity (4.1)
    * Support for freshness decorator to ensure sensitive operations have new authentication (4.0)
    * Support for email normalization and validation (4.0)
    * Unified signin (username, phone, passwordless) feature (3.4)
